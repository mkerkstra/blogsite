  blurb: `
    I am a software engineer from Austin, Texas, and I've been slinging code since studying computer science at Rice University. Fullstack typescript is my comfort zone, and I tend to drive products towards abstractions that improve the team's developer experience and enshrine logic that makes sense for their business between their tables, schemas, and types. Incentivized personal and technical growth and sharing that growth with your peers is what I enjoy most about working in this space.
